# ST494-Final-Project
Final Project for Statistical Learning Class, project done on "Scheduled Losses in the NBA"

This report looks at the idea of using fatigue as a factor to predict the outcome of an NBA game. Using previous ideas used by ESPN writer Baxter Holmes, we expand on them using other features and methods learned from this class. Using data from the 2018-2019 NBA season, we were able to create logistic regressions that predicted a subsection of games at above 80%. In addition, using these predictions to look at potential profits if money was placed on oddsmakers lines Through the process, we found that fatigue is in fact a viable tool for predicting NBA games.
